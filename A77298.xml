            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>Contraventions by delaying the Evacuation of Places</head>
                  <p>BY the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Articles of the ſaid Treaty it was agreed, That the places to be reſtored on either ſide, ſhould immediately after the exchange of the Ratifications be really and <hi>Bona fide</hi> Evacuated, without delay or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, for any Cauſe whatever.</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:135184:3"/>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding this agreement, and all the inſtances of his Catholick Majeſty to have the Treaty obſerved, The Miniſters of <hi>France,</hi> deſigning to reduce the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they were oblig'd to reſtore, to a point of irrecoverable Ruine and Deſolation, have notoriouſly delayed the Evacuation of the Places: Pretending, as to the Towns where there were Rivers, that the Ice had render'd them unpaſſable for Veſſels to carry away their Ammunition: And, as to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, That the Commonalty of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, under the Obedience of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty, being in arrear for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions demanded by <hi>France,</hi> had not given Security ſufficient to ſatisfie all their pretenſions.</p>

                  <head>The oppreſſion and Ruine of the ſame Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</head>
                  <p>Offers were made on the part of his Catholick Majeſty, that the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition ſhould be carried by Wagons, and that it might be done after the Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Towns, according to the Seventeenth Article of the Treaty: As to the Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have given all reaſonable ſatisfaction, and made it appear the Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought not however to be retarded on that account; but all to no purpoſe: For the <hi>French</hi> continued their Exactions of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:135184:3"/>Aids and Subſidies from Town and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and Quartered their Troops there Ten Weeks after the publication of the Peace, and forc'd the Inhabitants to pay every Company eight hundred Florins to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Recruits, beſides Free Quarter.</p>
                  <p>And when the Levyes for Recruits were ended, they made the Officers pay the Moneys in their Hands, received on that Account, into the Treaſury of the moſt Chriſtian King.</p>
                  <p>The Charge on this occaſion hath been ſo exceſſive, that it hath amounted to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Fifty thouſand Florins a day, and for the Ten Weeks time to ſeveral Millions. The <hi>French,</hi> not content with this, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their Exactions over ſeveral places, which have always belong'd to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty, particularly over the Countries of <hi>Aloſt, Grammont,</hi> and <hi>Waes,</hi> and generally all thoſe Countries that had paid Aids and Subſidies with the City of <hi>Ghent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Any Country that had been aſſeſs'd with <hi>Ghent</hi> towards payment of Taxes, the <hi>French</hi> took themſelves ſufficiently intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to, and made abſolute Proprietors of by right of War, as a Dependent of the City of <hi>Ghent,</hi> which they had poſſeſs'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of, but were obliged by the Treaty
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:135184:4"/>to have reſtored to his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, at the time they exacted Aids and Subſidies from them.</p>
                  <p>And though by the Fifth and Eighth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Treaty it was agreed, That the places to be Evacuated ſhould not be dammag'd, and that the Inhabitants ſhould not be charg'd, nor any demand be made of payment by them for any thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended due to the Souldiers quarter'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; yet the ſeverity of the <hi>French,</hi> in exacting Aids and Subſidies, was ſuch, that the Inhabitants of ſeveral Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages in <hi>Flanders, Hainault,</hi> and elſewhere, having deſerted their abode, the States of the Provinces, or thoſe Towns which had any thing left, were forc'd to pay the Rates aſſeſs'd on the depopulated Places.</p>

                  <head>The oppreſſion of his Catholick Majeſties Subjects under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Arrears of Contribution.</head>
                  <p>The Rigor they have us'd in the matter of Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without regard to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Covenant, or the moderation agreed on, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd.</p>
                  <p>They forc'd the Subjects of his Catholick Majeſty to travel from place to place, and dance attendance wherever the Intendents of <hi>France</hi> thought fit to Command them: They made them pay, not only after the concluſion but publication of the Peace,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:135184:4"/>the charge of Envoys, Reprizals, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Reprizals paſt in time of the War, though his Catholick Majeſty had revok'd all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of that kind. And when his Majeſties Subjects could not produce particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittances (which had been burnt, or loſt, or miſlaid in the War time) the <hi>French</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them to pay the ſame Duty twice, not ſatisfied with later Acquittances, by which it appeared the former Duty was diſcharg'd; and his Catholick Majeſty was oblig'd to pay what was demanded of ſuch of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as were inſolvent.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, they extended their Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in full Peace, to places that had not been ſubject to them in the time of War, nor paid any Aid or Subſidy to his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>'Tis evident by the Sixteenth Article of the Treaty, That the Contributions were not to be demanded after the Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>October,</hi> 1678. But it was the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>France,</hi> they ſhould be paid for two Months longer, under pretence, that his Catholick Majeſty had delayed the exchange of the Ratification; though in truth, the Term was prolong'd by mutual conſent, without altering the Treaty in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; and that, in the mean time the Suſpenſion of Arms continued, ſo that there
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:135184:5"/>was not any need of Guards or ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, and conſequently no cauſe to raiſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions; but the Exaction ought to have ceas'd upon that very account, if the Treaty had not limited when it ſhould determine.</p>

                  <head>Breach by deſtroying of Woods.</head>
                  <p>The Thirteenth Article of the Treaty ſays in expreſs terms, That the Subjects of either Part, ſhould from the day of Signing the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be put into full poſſeſſion of their Eſtates, and particularly of the Woods in the ſeveral Places, and that from that day no Wood ſhould be fallen by right of War.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Intendants have been Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a formal Contravention in this point; having cauſed a fall of Woods to be begun after the Treaty had been ſign'd, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious quantity to be cut down, which did belong to the Subjects of his Catholick Majeſty: The pretence being, they had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to do ſo, if the Ratifications were not perfected within the time limited for that purpoſe: And when it was made appear the Ratification had been effectually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd within the time prefix'd, their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, the Woods were fallen before they had the News; as if they had not been obliged in the leaſt to inquire after the progreſs of the Treaty, and that their diſtance from <hi>Nimmighen</hi> had given them full
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:135184:5"/>right to act the violences they pleas'd, upon ſuppoſition it was poſſible a thing was not done which had been effectually accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, they were ſo far from hearkning to the Inſtances made them, that they would leave to the Owners ſuch of the Trees fallen as remained on their Grounds, that they cauſed them to be carried away, and diſpoſed of them as they pleas'd.</p>

                  <p>Their Forces, before they were drawn off, in purſuance of the Treaty concluded and ratified, committed great ſpoil, and exceſſively waſted the Province of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi> by Marches and Counter-Marches of purpoſe, wherein they were Guilty of diſorders in abundance, uſing the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Subjects at diſcretion, Robbing their Houſes, and forceing them to ranſom their Perſons, as in the heat of the War.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chevalier de Sourdis,</hi> who, purſuant to the Treaty concluded with the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourgh,</hi> brought back the <hi>French</hi> Forces from the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Cleves,</hi> through the Provinces of <hi>Gueldres</hi> and <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> abſtained not from the like diſorders; have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forc'd his Catholick Majeſties Subjects of <hi>Welſt</hi> and <hi>Breehdorf</hi> to Build a Bridge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Roer,</hi> for carrying over his Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; the Officers of his Dragoons have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>This was certainly againſt the Laws of Nations and of Hoſpitality: For though this paſſage had been granted them on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourhg</hi> and the States of the United Provinces, to rid the Country of the former of theſe Forces, and the States of ſo dangerous Neighbours, they ought to have been content with the liberty of paſſage, and not have forc'd the Subjects of his Catholick Majeſty to bear their Charges.</p>

                  <p>The Province of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> hath more than any other felt their daily Contraventions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Treaty of Peace; for, in the time of full Peace, the <hi>French</hi> have taken in that Province with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reaſon, other than that of the Right of Arms, a great number of Towns, Caſtles, and Territories of very large extent.</p>
                  <p>The Caſtle of <hi>Bourg</hi> of <hi>Rodemacker</hi> is a Signiory in chief, depending immediately of his Catholick Majeſty, as Duke of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emburgh;</hi> it holds immediately of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Perſon, and does its Fealty and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Services due to his Majeſty before the General Governour of that Province, as appears by Surveys and other Records, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thoſe of 1552, and 1553. And by the admiſſion of the Marqueſs of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in 1562. The <hi>French</hi> pretended to it as belonging to them by the Ceſſion of <hi>Thionville</hi> by the Treaty of the <hi>Pyrenees:</hi> But in the Conferences held for execution of that Treaty, the Right of his Catholick Majeſty was ſo clearly made out and maintain'd, that he continued in poſſeſſion of the Caſtle and Burrough; and in the beginning of the War in 1667. His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty granted them a Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:135184:10"/>at the requeſt of the Marchioneſs of <hi>Baden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Publick Faith ought in that caſe to have ſecured them from his Arms, but hath been ſo far from ſecuring them, that the <hi>French</hi> Troops, expreſly contrary to the Neutrality, poſſeſs'd themſelves both of the Caſtle and Burrough: By the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle</hi> reparation was agreed to be made for this Violence; but the laſt War breaking out before reparation ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, his Catholick Majeſty retook the the Burrough and Caſtle, and continued a Garriſon there till both were demoliſhed: So that the laſt poſſeſſion hath gone with the right of his Catholick Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>Yet, though after this, and eſpecially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the concluſion of the Peace at <hi>Nimmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen,</hi> all violent attempts and ſeizures by force ought to have ceas'd; the Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> have not only poſſeſs'd themſelves of the ſaid Caſtle and Burrough, (for no other reaſon than that Right muſt ſubmit to Might) but have ſeiz'd other Lands to the Gates of <hi>Luxembourgh,</hi> pretending they are Dependences of the Burrough or Caſtle of <hi>Rodemacker,</hi> for which there is not any more colour than for the pretended depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>Rodemacker</hi> on <hi>Thionville.</hi>

                  <p>Upon this ground it was, that in <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>

                  <p>The complaints made on this account to the Court of <hi>France</hi> appeared ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that <hi>Monſieur de Pompone</hi> the twentieth of <hi>October,</hi> 1679. declar'd to the <hi>Sieur Del Val,</hi> by expreſs Order of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, that the Intendant ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been charg'd to cauſe all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the places his Majeſty was poſſeſs'd of in <hi>Alſace</hi> and <hi>Lorain</hi> to ſwear Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to him, had of his own head ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

                  <p>After this Anſwer it was expected they would have at leaſt abſtain'd from Force; but the fifteenth of <hi>November,</hi> 1679. they took thoſe places again, and farm'd out the Toll of the Bridge of <hi>Eſperange,</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Catholick Majeſty; and without any regard to the Proteſtation made by his Attorney General, and accepted by him they had conſtituted Commander of <hi>Rode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macker,</hi> they order'd the Ancient Farmer of that Duty under his Catholick Majeſty to pay it to the uſe of his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; and let the Governour of <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> know, they would not permit his Catholick Majeſty to receive any Aids or Impoſitions from the places they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to ſwear Allegiance to the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King, and that they would make the Subjects of his Catholick Majeſty pay double what ſhould be ſo impoſed or received on his part.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>January,</hi> 1680. they ſeiz'd <hi>Ryaville,</hi> and ſeventeen Villages annext to it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending

                  </p>
                  <p>Their proceedings as to the Seigniories and Lands of <hi>Ruſſy, Putlange,</hi> and <hi>Preſche</hi> are yet more enormous; for the fifth of <hi>May,</hi> 1680. the <hi>Count de Buſſy</hi> preſented himſelf at the Frontier of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> with a Body of <hi>French</hi> Horſe and Dragoons, with reſolution to enter that Province on the morrow, if the Souldiers his Catholick Majeſty had in thoſe Caſtles did not retire thence in the mean time; which, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent greater inconveniences, they did: And the <hi>Count de Buſſy</hi> immediately poſſeſs'd himſelf of the Places, plac'd <hi>French</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons in them, and forc'd the Province of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> to pay the Charges the Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of his Troops ſaid they had been at, and impriſoned the Provoſt of <hi>Verton,</hi> till he had Compounded with them for a hundred Piſtols.</p>

                  <p>Beſides all this, they forc'd the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to make Preſents to the Commanders of theſe Troops for their Oppreſſion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, as the Effects of the Amity and fair Correſpondence they had promiſed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve by the Treaty of Peace: So that (to put a ſtop to thoſe Violences) they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up to them (beſides <hi>Chiny</hi> and its

                  <p>And though this difficulty ceas'd ſince <hi>September</hi> 1680. and that the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of <hi>France</hi> the fifteenth of that Month dclar'd they were ſatisfied with the Powers Communicated to them that day; and that they were content to enter upon the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet they ſought out ſeveral preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to delay the Affair for ſeveral Months. And when they could not find any more; but expreſſed themſelves ſatisfied with the Reaſons of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> 'twas but in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and meerly to amuſe them, for they continued to decide all by the way of Arms, eluding all inſtances made to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>And when the Commiſſioners of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty deſired to Treat at <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi> of the Affairs of <hi>Luxemburgh;</hi> the Commiſſioners of <hi>France</hi> declared openly, they had not any Commiſſion or power
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:135184:28"/>to Treat of them there, and that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Execution of the Treaty of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and not that of <hi>Nimmighen;</hi> though they very well knew, neither his Catholick Majeſty, nor any on his behalf intervened in the Treaty of <hi>Munſter,</hi> nor in that of <hi>Nimmighen,</hi> as relating to that of <hi>Munſter;</hi> the one and the other having been made ſeperately between the Plenipotentiaries of the Emperour and the moſt Chriſtian King.</p>
                  <p>And as to the reſtoring his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to the Poſſeſſion of the Places and Countries Uſurp'd from him by Force ſince the Publiſhing of the Peace; the <hi>French</hi> have been ſo far from doing his Majeſty Right, that they have inceſſantly acted new Violences and Injuries, and formed other pretenſions at the Conference, not only deſtitute of Ground, but any appearance of Reaſon: Inſomuch, that they inſiſted the moſt Chriſtian King had Right over the Towns and Countries of <hi>Aloſt, Niuoue, Gramont,</hi> and abundance of other Places, to the very Lands of the States of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited Provinces: And demanded an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent for them from his Catholick Majeſty, pretending that by the taking of <hi>Ghent,</hi> their Arms had given them Right of Entry into thoſe Countries; and that they had had
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:135184:28"/>ſome kind of Poſſeſſion of them. Whereas in truth they are open places, and have ſo continued during the War: So that <hi>France</hi> could not on that account gain any right to them, nor hinder his Catholick Majeſty from acceſſe to them, and conſequently from preſerving his Right and Poſſeſſion as he hath done. And that the moſt Chriſtian King, after the taking of <hi>Ghent,</hi> pretended not to them but as Dependences of that City, which he is particularly and expreſly obliged to reſtore to his Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, after the Publication of the Peace, the <hi>French</hi> were Quartered in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as Places belonging to his Catholick Majeſty, to Force <hi>Spain</hi> to pay the Reſidue of the Contributions as pretended to by <hi>France:</hi> And when they were paid as is mentioned before, the moſt Chriſtian King drew his Forces out of thoſe Places at the time he Evacuated <hi>Ghent,</hi> that his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majeſty might be left in the peaceable Poſſeſſion of them.</p>
                  <p>Add hereto, that theſe Places are eſſential Parts of the <hi>Barriere,</hi> for which the moſt Chriſtian King hath obliged himſelf to reſt ſatisfied with the Ceſſion of certain Places agreed to be given him in exchange. And that in the Liſt of Places named in the

                  <p n="14">14. This Rule is grounded on the Right of Arms, and derived from the Law of War, by which it is generally holden, the Conquerour ſucceeds him that is diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and repreſents him in his Conqueſts. So that the Grants of Dependences, and Ceſſions (of things annexed) in Treaties of Peace, are to be underſtood (by a tacit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in Law) to have relation always to the laſt Poſſeſſion of the Diſpoſſeſſed, tho it be not ſo expreſſed in the Treaty.</p>

                  <p>By which it appears, the Homage, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively done, and continued ſeveral Ages, for the Land and Lordſhip of <hi>Libinnes,</hi> was purſuant to the Survey made by <hi>William de Libinnes,</hi> and the Feoffment from the Earl of <hi>Namur</hi> to <hi>John de Celles.</hi>

                  <p>So that the Seizure of the Woods of <hi>Lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binnes,</hi> and of <hi>Marlaigne,</hi> lately made by the <hi>French,</hi> is a manifeſt and notorious U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation, conſidering the Evidences above mentioned, and his Catholick Majeſties poſſeſſion of the ſaid Woods ſeveral Ages.</p>
                  <p>True it is, That under the Juriſdiction of <hi>Libinnes,</hi> there are two little parcels of Wood, containing about ſixteen Bonniers more or leſs, called the <hi>Sarts</hi> or <hi>Sauts,</hi> and belonging to the Abbot of St. <hi>Gerard,</hi> as <hi>Sieur de Libinnes:</hi> But they are diſtinct and ſeparate from thoſe of <hi>Marlaigne,</hi> and we grant the Propriety, as the Poſſeſſion of them belongs to the Prelate of St. <hi>Gerard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this it appears, His Catholick Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty

                  <p>Becauſe the Council of this Province had ſent into the Villages between the <hi>Sambre</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and into the Provoſtſhip of <hi>Poilvach</hi> the Placarts laſt Publiſhed by his Highneſs: Count <hi>Montbron,</hi> ſent Order to the Mayors and Inhabitants of the ſame places, prohibiting them to receive ſuch Placarts, on pain of being puniſhed as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and threatning to ſend to the Gallies, the Bearers of ſuch Placarts, whom he calls Vagabonds.</p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:135184:104"/>that the Order was, they ſhould be Taxed at 600 Florins for <hi>Bieſme,</hi> inſtead of 1945, they formerly paid his Catholick Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>The like Order, Dated the ſecond of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> 1683, was ſent to <hi>Wepion,</hi> and to <hi>Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toir,</hi> a Dependent of the Baliage of <hi>Bovignes,</hi> whereby it appears, that <hi>Hontoir</hi> is Aſſeſſed at Forty Florins to be forthwith paid into the hands of the Lord of <hi>Bieſme</hi> appointed by <hi>France</hi> to collect the ſaid Aſſeſſments.
